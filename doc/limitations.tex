\chapter{Limitations}\label{chp:limitations}

These are the limitations that apply to the pattern text:\index{pattern!limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item The crochet pattern text input is not inclusive of all terminology recognized by American crochet terminology, or other natural language. The crochet pattern text input is limited to what is included in the table describing the grammar used by the @patbox.
\item Supported crochet pattern text is limited to the list of acceptable tokens only. Invisible characters, combining characters, or other Unicode characters that interfere with normal text display may cause parsing errors.
\end{itemize}

Limitations on the crochet pattern text input apply to uploaded pattern texts too.

For performance reasons, there are limitations on the number of stitches that @CC can render.
@CC supports patterns with up to \num{20000} stitches before user interactions have unreasonable delays of above \qty{300}{ms}. 

The @CC application makes a few assumptions about real-world crochet \term{pattern}[s], which limits what crochet patterns can be rendered satisfactorily. Here are the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Crochet patterns only contain one \term{foundation} stitch.
\item Crochet patterns do not contain yarn threads intersecting through each other.
\item Crochet patterns are composed of a common set of well-defined stitches.
\item Crochet patterns are constructed one stitch at a time.
\item Each stitch connects to the previous one in the pattern and possibly to other earlier stitches in the pattern.
\end{itemize}

\section{Troubleshooting}

You input a pattern with an unrecognized stitch name.
\Solution{Modify the pattern to change or remove the unrecognized stitch name. The recognized stitches are listed in the \nameref{sec:terms} section.}

You input a pattern with invalid or unrecognized syntax.
\Solution{Modify the pattern to conform to the grammar laid out in the \nameref{sec:terms} section.}

You try to load a file that is not a crochet pattern.
\Solution{Open a plain text file instead, or open the desired file with the appropriate software and copy and paste the pattern text into the @CC application.}

You input a pattern with an excessively large amount of stitches.
\Solution{Reduce the number of stitches in the pattern. See the \nameref{chp:limitations} chapter for more details.}

You enter an invalid value in the settings panel. For example, a non-number when a number is required.
\Solution{Enter a valid number without spaces, thousands separators, or other symbols.}

You open the app in an outdated/incompatible browser.
\Solution{Use a device that satisfies the requirements listed in the \nameref{sec:csassumptions} section.}

You close the window without saving the pattern being typed.
\Solution{Ensure you have used the \ui{Download} function to save your work before closing the web browser window.}

You add more than one \term{foundation} stitch.
\Solution{Remove the additional foundation stitches. @CC is only designed to render one crochet part at a time; different parts which are intended to be sewn together must be rendered separately.}

\section{Tips}

\begin{itemize}
\item The @exsel can be used to load a variety of sample crochet patterns, which can help you get started.
\item Amigurumi patterns typically start with a magic circle, while clothing and similar textiles typically start with a slip knot and chain stitches.
\item Use the @dbtn to avoid losing your work.

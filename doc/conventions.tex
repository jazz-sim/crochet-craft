\chapter{Conventions}\label{chp:conventions}

\section{User Assumptions}

You, the user of @CC, are assumed to understand American crochet terminology, and be competent in the basic usage of the device that is running @CC.

\section{Computer System Assumptions}\label{sec:csassumptions}

@CC runs in a web browser, so it is assumed that you are using a browser that is up-to-date, and has not been tampered with.
It is assumed that you are using a device with a keyboard and mouse.
If you wish to use any features of the computer filesystem, it is assumed that your device has sufficient free space for these features.

\section{Notational Conventions}

The following text conventions are used in this manual:

\begin{itemize}
\item Libertine is used for normal text.
\item \emph{Libertine italicized} is used for new terms in normal text.
\item \textbf{Libertine bolded} is used for emphasis.
% \item Libertine in gray is used for section titles. For example, the title of the ``Conventions'' section is in Heading 3.
\item \io{Noto Sans} is used for program names and user interface input/output.
\item \ui{Noto Sans italicized} is used for widget names.
\item \Verb`Bitstream Vera Sans Mono` is used for @ir contents.
\item \emph{\Verb`Bitstream Vera Sans Mono italicized`} is used for variables of @ir syntax.
\end{itemize}

\section{Terms}\label{sec:terms}

Listing~\ref{lst:grammar} details the basic \term{grammar} used when parsing the pattern text.
Furthermore, table~\ref{tbl:keywords} contains the list of \term[grammar!keywords]{keywords}.
In each row, the keywords listed next to each other can be used inter\-changeably.
For example, \io{sc2tog} has the same meaning as \io{dec}, so whenever the grammar includes ``\io{dec}'', \io{sc2tog} can also be used.

\end{table}

The following terms are used throughout the manual:

\begin{description}
\item[@CC**] the name of the web application
\item[\term*{user}] the person who uses @CC, addressed by ``you''
\item[\term*{device}] whatever electronic device @CC is currently running on, inclusive of hardware and operating system

% Basic crochet things

\item[\term*{yarn}] the material used in the art of crochet
\item[\term*{amigurumi}] the Japanese art of knitting or crocheting stuffed toys out of yarn
\item[\term*{pattern}] a set of textual instructions that detail how to create a crochet project

% CC things
\item[@layout**] the buttons, text boxes, widgets, and other elements visible on the screen in the @CC app
\item[@renarea**] the area of the screen used for displaying the @rm

\item[@ebtn**] the button in the @menu that, when pressed, allows you to download your @rm as an @OBJ file to your local device
\end{description}

\section{Other Abbreviations}

\begin{description}
\item[@ir**] any kind of data, not visible to the user, used internally by @CC to represent crochet patterns
\item[\Term*{GUI}] Graphical User Interface
\item[@OBJ**] a geometry definition file format, to which a @rm can be exported
\item[\emph{what you see is what you get} (\Term*{WYSIWYG})] software that displays content in a realistic form while it is being edited
\end{description}

\section{Basic User Interface Goals}

@CC aims to be a friendly \term{GUI} for crochet amateurs and enthusiasts.
Not much crochet modelling software exists, and most of this software does not provide fast and accessible rendering.
The main appeal of @CC is from the benefits of its \term{WYSIWYG} approach and its capability of fast pattern iteration.
Its basic goals are:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is simple for you to import your crochet pattern text into the @patbox, and it is simple for you to export a 3D object of the @rm in @OBJ format.
\item It is easy for you to view your @rm at many different angles.
\item It is easy for a pattern designer to iterate and make modifications to a pattern, to improve it.
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization of this Manual}

The remainder of this manual is organized primarily on use cases.
The \nameref{chp:use} chapter describes the basic use cases, including the possible GUI interactions in depth.
After the \nameref{chp:use} chapter, the \nameref{chp:troubleshooting} chapter describes what you should do if you encounter common errors as well as how to use @CC effectively.
Lastly, the \nameref{chp:limitations} chapter describes the restrictions on the current version of @CC.

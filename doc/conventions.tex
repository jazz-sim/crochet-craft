\chapter{Conventions}\label{chp:conventions}

\section{User Assumptions}

You, the user of @CC, are assumed to understand American crochet terminology, and be competent in the basic usage of the device that is running @CC.

\section{Computer System Assumptions}\label{sec:csassumptions}

@CC runs in a browser, so it is assumed that you are using a browser that is up-to-date, and has not been tampered with. It is assumed that you are using a device with a keyboard and mouse. If you wish to use any features of the computer filesystem, it is assumed that there is sufficient space for these features.

\section{Notational Conventions}

The following text conventions are used in this manual:

\begin{itemize}
\item Libertine is used for normal text.
\item \emph{Libertine italicized} is used for emphasis and new terms in normal text.
\item \textbf{Libertine bolded} is used for emphasis in figures and tables.
% \item Libertine in gray is used for section titles. For example, the title of the ``Conventions'' section is in Heading 3.
\item \io{Noto Sans} is used for program names and user interface input/output.
\item \ui{Noto Sans italicized} is used for widget names.
\item \Verb`Bitstream Vera Sans Mono` is used for @IR contents.
\item \emph{\Verb`Bitstream Vera Sans Mono italicized`} is used for variables of @IR syntax.
\end{itemize}

\section{Terms}\label{sec:terms}

Listing~\ref{lst:grammar} details the basic \term{grammar} used when parsing the pattern text.
Furthermore, table~\ref{tbl:keywords} contains the list of \term[grammar!keywords]{keywords}. In each row, the keywords listed next to each other can be used inter\-changeably. For example, \io{ss} has the same meaning as \io{slst}, so whenever the grammar includes ``\io{slst},'' \io{ss} can also be used.

    \caption{The keywords and their meanings, as recognized by @CC.}
    \label{tbl:keywords}
\end{table}

The following terms are used throughout the manual:

\begin{itemize}
\item @CC* - the name of the web application / program.
\item \term{user} - the person who uses @CC, addressed by ``you''. 
\item \term{crochet} - this refers to the ``process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials''.
\item \term{yarn} - this refers to ``a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, used in sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, ropemaking, and the production of textiles''.
\item \term[pattern!text]{pattern text} - this refers to a set of textual instructions that detail how to create a crochet project. 
\item \term{stitch} - a simple, indivisible knot built on top of previous stitches, used to build patterns. See Figure 2 for a list of acceptable stitches.
\item \term{foundation} - this is the initial loop used to start a pattern. See the table above for a list of acceptable foundations.
\item @RM* - this refers to the 3D object created and shown based on the inputted pattern text.
\item @CRW* - this refers to the area of the screen used for displaying the @RM.
\item \term{hook} - ``A crochet hook, or crochet needle, is an implement used to make loops in thread or yarn and to interlock them into crochet stitches''.
\item \term{attribute} - a characteristic of a stitch, where the characteristics are:
    \begin{itemize}\compact
        \item \term{colour} - the pigmentation of the stitch
        \item \term{thickness} - the diameter of the yarn that constitutes the stitch
        \item \term{laxity} - the looseness of the stitch. In other words, the spacing between stitches
        \item \term{hook size} - used to determine the scale of the render model
    \end{itemize}
\item @IR* - refers to @CC code responsible for drawing the @RM in the @CRW.
\item \term{session} - an invocation of @CC.
\item @PatSidebar* - this refers to the user interface widget on the left side of the @CRW, which contains the @PTI, the @ASBs, and the @NCSB. The @PatSidebar is used for causing input to the IR. The content changes in the @PatSidebar affect the @RM and the @CRW.
\item @PTI* - this refers to the text box which holds your input pattern text.
\item @ASBs* - this refers to the set of buttons below of the @PTI where each button corresponds to a different type of stitch that is supported by the grammar.
\item @NCSB* - this refers to the button below the @ASBs which opens up a colour picker to set the colour for the next added stitch.
\item @PropSidebar* - this refers to the user interface widget on the right side of the @CRW, which contains the @YCP, @YTS, @SLS, and the @HSS. This sidebar causes input to the @IR. The content changes in the @PropSidebar affect the @RM and the @CRW. The content changes in the @PropSidebar will update the @PTI in the @PatSidebar.
\item @YCP* - this refers to the button on the @PropSidebar which opens up a colour picker to set the colour for the selected stitch on the @RM.
\item @YTS* - this refers to the input box on the @PropSidebar that changes the thickness of the yarn for the selected stitch on the @RM.
\item @SLS* - this refers to the slider on the @PropSidebar that changes the laxity of the selected stitch on the @RM.

\item @UB* - this refers to the button in the @MenuBar that when pressed allows you to select a text file from your local device such that the contents of that text file populate the @PTI.
\item @DB* - this refers to the button in the @MenuBar that when pressed allows you to download your pattern text with some metadata as a text file to your local device.
\item @EB* - this refers to the button in the @MenuBar that when pressed allows you to download your @RM as a .OBJ file to your local device.
\item \Term{OBJ} - ``a geometry definition file format first developed by Wavefront Technologies for its Advanced Visualizer animation package''.
\item @ScLayout* - made up of a @MenuBar, @PatSidebar, @PropSidebar, @CRW, and potentially a @RM, if there is a valid pattern text to render.
\item \emph{left mouse click} (\term{LMC}) - a left mouse click. 
\item \emph{right mouse click} (\term{RMC}) - a right mouse click.
\item \emph{what you see is what you get} (WYSIWYG) - this refers to ``software that allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product''.
\item \term{device} - this refers to whatever @CC is currently running on, inclusive of hardware and operating system.
\item \term{amigurumi} - this refers to the ``Japanese art of knitting or crocheting small, stuffed yarn creatures''.
\end{itemize}

\section{Other Abbreviations}

\begin{itemize}
\item \Term{GUI} - Graphical User Interface
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic User Interface Goals}

@CC aims to be a friendly \term{GUI} for crochet amateurs and enthusiasts. Not much crochet modelling software exists, and most of this software does not provide fast and accessible rendering. The main appeal of @CC is from the benefits of \term{WYSIWYG} and the ability to view the @RM from any angle. Some other basic goals for the GUI of @CC are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specifying the attributes of a stitch can be done from within the @PTI, before rendering, as well as after rendering.
\item There is no need to confirm the end of a @PTI.
\item It is easy for you to minimize, open, and move sidebars such that the @RM on the @CRW is easily visible.
\item It is simple for you to import your crochet pattern text into the @PTI, and it is simple for you to export a 3D object of the @RM in OBJ format.
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization of this Manual}

The remainder of this manual is organized primarily on use cases. The \nameref{chp:use} chapter describes the basic use cases, including the possible GUI interactions in depth. After the \nameref{chp:use} chapter, the \nameref{chp:troubleshooting} chapter describes what you should do if you encounter common errors as well as how to use @CC effectively. Lastly, the \nameref{chp:limitations} chapter describes the restrictions on the current version of @CC.

## Overview

This branch is meant to test out [three.js](https://threejs.org/). 

### Init - 2023-04-04
Adds a test page for three.js, with the sample code provided by the [package description](https://yarnpkg.com/package?name=three), made to work with svelte with minimal edits.

Note: The `WebGLRenderer` constructor will attempt to access the `document` object, which will result in an error with svelte. The current fix is to wrap it (and the entire sample code) in a callback function to svelte's `onMount`.
